# 1. Gamestonk tests

The purpose of this document is to explain how `GamestonkTerminal` envisions solving the following issues regarding tests  :  
- Having/Maintaining tests for this tool
- Running tests for this tool

Having/Maintaining tests is about making sure every `GamestonkTerminal` update comes with the right tests.

Running tests is about keeping usable by the contributors.

We will explain the processes and automations designed to solve this issues.

## 1.1. Steps for `PullRequest`

Here are the steps to write proper tests for Gamestonk :

    A. Find right place
    B. Verify coverage is above 90%
    C. Set the right markers

**A. Find right place**

Put the code following the same module and package structure than `gamestonk_terminal` package.

**B. Verify coverage is above 90%**

Once you made your `PullRequest` an automation will let you know whether or not you have the proper amount of tests coverage.

You can also run the following command to check your coverage manually :
- `pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=90`

**C. Set the right markers**

If parts of your have specificities like :
- being `slow`
- requiring `network` connectivity
- requiring `authentication` to `APIs`

Then the proper markers should be sent on each test.


The rests of this document is there to provide a deeper comprehension of this steps.

# 2. Having tests

Here we will see how to build tests for GamestonkTerminal.

In order to build tests we need to know :
- What to test ?
- Where to put those tests ?

## 2.1. What to test ?
Every classes and methods which can be publicly accessed should be tested.

The purpose here, is not to verify the soundness (testing every possible variation) of a code but to :

    A. Run the python interpreter through every parts of the code
    B. Automate the common sense tests that the user or developer would have done manually

*Can I inject a bug in the code and still pass the tests ?*

If the answer is yes, then it's probably a good idea to add test for this case.

## 2.2. Where to put those tests ?

In the `tests` folder.

NOTES
- how should it be organised
- one test file for each class seems easy to track
- keeping the same folder structure than the `gamestonk_terminal` module seems to make sense
- what happened to slow tests ?
- what happened to network tests ?
- wheat happened to logged in tests ?

# 3. Maintain tests

The PR process should force tests to be written in the case that :
- coverage is reduced (we need a coverage indicator)
- a bug is was undetected

## 3.1. What are the indicators ?

NOTES
- Do we have coverage indicator running ?
- We can use pytest-cov

Every time a PR is made a coverage indicator should be displayed.

## 3.2. What is the PR checklist ?

A tests update might be asked whenever the answer to one of the following question is `yes` :

    A. Is this PR fixing bug which was not detected by the current tests ?
    B. Is this PR reducing code coverage ?
    C. Is this PR adding features ?
    D. Is this PR updating features ?

# 4. Running tests

Provided that the tests where properly built and maintained.

Running them will allow you testing in matter of minutes : dozens of cases that would requires hours to check manually.

This is a powerful tool : here we will see how to run it.

## 4.1. How to run all the tests ?

TODO
- put the command

## 4.1. How to run specific features ?

Markers can be used to run specific parts of the 

|**Markers**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|
|slow|Tests which are slow to run.|
|net|Tests which require network connectivity.|
|login|Tests|

Section `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` of this document contains full list of markers :
- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

One can also select run individual folder or files.

TODO
- explain how to run invidual folder or file
- explain how to run specific markers
- list the avaialble tags
- put the command : slow, network
